# DCC Samples & Utlities

## DCC BASH Scripts

- [DCC Bash Scripts](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/rescomp/dcc-bash-scripts) - Handful of useful bash scripts and slurm commands that can come in handy to the users of DCC. Created by RC Intern Shrey Gupta.

## Materials Science
- [Running FHI-aims](https://github.com/uthpalaherath/fhiaims-dcc) - Sample build process and submission script to run the materials simulation software [FHI-aims](https://fhi-aims.org).


## Intern Projects

- looking for link - Student projects developing interactive visualizations and predictive modeling tools for a Malaria Early Warning System in Peru and Predicting US Snow FAll using sea surface temperatures. Students worked in Python on the DCC and partnered with researchers in the Duke Nicholas School of the Environment. [Final Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usYsK2Uqa18).

- [Codep2022AST](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/rescomp/codep2022AST) - Student project developing interactive visualization tools and workflows to visualize national risk data in relation to above ground petrochemical storage tanks and US Census data. The visualizations were created using Holoviews and Datashader in JupyterLab notebooks that were hosted in OnDemand sessions on the Duke Compute Cluster.

- [Codep2022Reddit](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/rescomp/codep2022Reddit) - Student project developing interactive visualization tools and workflows to visualize sleep patterns using Reddit data. The visualizations were created using Holoviews and Datashader in JupyterLab notebooks that were hosted in OnDemand sessions on the Duke Compute Cluster.

- [CodePlus ML-NLP](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/code-plus-ml-nlp/codeplus-final) - Using ML/NLP to Identify Relationships and Similarities in Grant Proposal Texts.

## Infrastructure Helpers

- [slurm-metrics](https://github.com/DukeRC/slurm-metrics) - Pulls in some additional metrics for reporting on Slurm that can be read by Telegraf

# Globus Samples

- [AVstack Core](https://github.com/avstack-lab/lib-avstack-core) and [AVstack API](https://github.com/avstack-lab/lib-avstack-core) - The [AVstack](https://www.avstack.org) writes code for autonomous vehicle design, implementation, test, and analysis. They scripted an installation process of their software that includes an automated data download (see the models directory) from Duke storage shared via Globus. This allowed them to create a data repository large enough to host all of their sample models.
