## Intern Projects

- looking for link - Student projects developing interactive visualizations and predictive modeling tools for a Malaria Early Warning System in Peru and Predicting US Snow FAll using sea surface temperatures. Students worked in Python on the DCC and partnered with researchers in the Duke Nicholas School of the Environment. [Final Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usYsK2Uqa18).

- [Codep2022AST](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/rescomp/codep2022AST) - Student project developing interactive visualization tools and workflows to visualize national risk data in relation to above ground petrochemical storage tanks and US Census data. The visualizations were created using Holoviews and Datashader in JupyterLab notebooks that were hosted in OnDemand sessions on the Duke Compute Cluster.

- [Codep2022Reddit](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/rescomp/codep2022Reddit) - Student project developing interactive visualization tools and workflows to visualize sleep patterns using Reddit data. The visualizations were created using Holoviews and Datashader in JupyterLab notebooks that were hosted in OnDemand sessions on the Duke Compute Cluster.

- [CodePlus ML-NLP](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/code-plus-ml-nlp/codeplus-final) - Using ML/NLP to Identify Relationships and Similarities in Grant Proposal Texts.
